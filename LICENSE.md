Continuum License – Mission Statement
The mission of the Continuum License is to maximize the public good, ensure that profits flow back into the hands of the people, and incentivize private innovation up to a reasonable juncture.
This license exists for people—their collective power, their sovereignty, and their right to hold accountable the systems that shape their lives. It is not a tool of enclosure, but a living structure of reciprocity, responsibility, and ethical alignment.
It is a covenant between creators and communities, between innovation and justice—a way of ensuring that what is built for the people remains by the people.
Continuum License – Provisional Draft v1.0

The continuum license will live on OpenCollective until it is transferred to its own public trust structure based on its own principles and guidelines.
At the juncture where the collective decides to move to the public trust model, a separate instance will be made for those who wish to remain on OpenCollective.
 All software developed under OpenCollective will be fully open source within the bounds of ethics to be decided by the collective.
