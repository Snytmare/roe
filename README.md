It's like rain that falls and remembers where it fell, each drop informing where the next drop falls, until all at once the sky clears and the sun shines through.

The Random Onion Entropy protocol uses recursive mapping to seed entropy in nodes and then output a deterministic path that is fully encrypted. The path is non deterministic but ultimately maps to A, B, C and linearly puts you through the network.

Heavily inspired by the TOR protocol, and by rain.
